This is the solution of no. 3 problem in the LeetCode,
where the website of the problem is as follow:
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

The description of problem is as follow:
==========================================================================================================
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
Â 
Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
